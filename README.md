# IMAGE CLASSIFIER :
           Contextual image classification, a topic of pattern recognition in computer vision, is an approach of classification based on contextual information in images. "Contextual" means this approach is focusing on the relationship of the nearby pixels, which is also called neighbourhood.
           Image classification is the primary domain, in which deep neural networks play the most important role of medical image analysis. The image classification accepts the given input images and produces output classification for identifying whether the disease is present or not.
           I have also created a image classifier , which can clasify any type of images in it .
